A lot of DAW components also work for video editors, animation editors, and more - timelines, layer systems, pause/play/record.\r\n- A whole section for code related blocks/components. CodeMirror editor is neat. But then terminal. Make a whole IDE block. Powering it is beyond the scope of just a UI component library - but so be it. Demo WebVM, Rolldown, webcontainers, remote VMs, etc. Then have a demo for plugin systems. Another idea is a bytecode interpreter for capability handles like the spell game.\r\n- Definitely a shadertoy clone!\r\n- React flow database schema thingy, perhaps.\r\n- Definitely fancy table! I mean really fancy though - like with user scripting, permissions. Coda level tables. More than just tables - have a whole section that's like this. It's UIs for a data +auth system, maybe? Along these same lines: inspectors and serializers for arbitrary data types like objects, numbers, strings. This goes with on-the-fly generated UIs it's important. Auto validation and stuff. Actually key section here - smart views. Think Coda/Notion tables->list->cards->calendar->whatever. This is super important.\r\n- Definitely a keyboard shortcut system that lets you record and remap them and stuff.\r\n- Non-UI stuff that can plug in as data sources or arbitrary \"connectors\" or sync thingies: PipeDream, for example.\r\n- SVG editor, pixel art editor, keyframe editor.",
