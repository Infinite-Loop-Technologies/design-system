      "body": "- DAW and music related components. Could be a whole category! Definitely midi editor, curve editors. A lot of DAW components also work for video editors, animation editors, and more - timelines, layer systems, pause/play/record.\r\n- A whole section for code related blocks/components. CodeMirror editor is neat. But then terminal. Make a whole IDE bMlock. Powering it is beyond the scope of just a UI component library - but so be it. Demo WebVM, Rolldown, webcontainers, remote VMs, etc. Then have a demo for plugin systems. Another idea is a bytecode interpreter for capability handles like the spell game.\r\n- Definitely a shadertoy clone!\r\n- React flow database schema thingy, perhaps.\r\n- Definitely fancy table! I mean really fancy though - like with user scripting, permissions. Coda level tables. More than just tables - have a whole section that's like this. It's UIs for a data +auth system, maybe? Along these same lines: inspectors and serializers for arbitrary data types like objects, numbers, strings. This goes with on-the-fly generated UIs it's important. Auto validation and stuff. Actually key section here - smart views. Think Coda/Notion tables->list->cards->calendar->whatever. This is super important.\r\n- Definitely a keyboard shortcut system that lets you record and remap them and stuff. Maybe structure this with an intent/command bus to make it awesome.\r\n- A selection box + selectable system to go with drag and drop and more - again, with an intent/command bus to make it clean and sexy\r\n- Non-UI stuff that can plug in as data sources or arbitrary \"connectors\" or sync thingies: PipeDream, for example.\r\n- SVG editor, pixel art editor, keyframe editor.\r\n- Huge: a theming system, ideally one that goes beyond boring old shadcn color reskinning - then have some premade themes. But really cool ones like pixel/8-bit,, liquid glass, etc. \r\n- Maybe set up some awesome animations, art, and more, in different styles. Before when I mentioned themes - perhaps these could go with some of the themes and each theme gets its own page, or something.\r\n- Rive integration! It's pretty trivial, but perhaps I could attempt to do something cool like literally pulling straight from your Rive file to make it easy, or something.\r\n- Monetization of this site in a non-evil way so that I can survive and work more on this without starving to death\r\n- Maybe a bunch of game-related cool stuff, such as an inventory system example. And then going further along these lines; a Unity asset for embedded browser UIs, but performant optimized ones.\r\n- A system for UI adapters so a lot of stuff here can run in a TUI and more - this is maybe a bit far-fetched.\r\n- More WYSIWYG editors, including ones for the content on this docs page itself. Goal: admin & viewer workflows dynamically load based on roles, so no extra bundle size for just non-auth viewers who shouldn't get a whole fancy UI.",

And improve the look of selected tabs.\r\n- Add gestures for better scrolling, dnd, and more.\r\n- Fix the issue where you can't drag panel groups around (but keep it as an option)\r\n- Fix the vertical tabs system, it is completely bugged\r\n- Fix free floating panels (shift-drag) - you can't drag them, I think similar issue to not being able to grab panel groups\r\n- Improve the drag hover system and the spacing of the boundaries for how a panel snaps around.\r\n- Add auto-layout and perhaps even fancier auto-tiling modes like leftwm-layouts\r\n- Make sure it's easier to use from the outside, e.g. keyboard shortcuts, undo/redo, persistence. Perhaps a command/intent bus system so you can easily map to keyboard shortcuts externally. ",
