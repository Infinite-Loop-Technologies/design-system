/**
 * Plan for Skraps DAW
 * - data model is important. I like Jazz - anonymous accounts with optional conversion.
 * Even though this is on loop-kit site its fine. I can use loop-kit accounts for skraps for now.
 * conversion later.
 * Use probably jazz, or loro, or custom datastructures.
 * Have an invite/share/presence UI.
 * sort of have routing - links for joining daw session with ID.
 * BUT - also have multiple panel support!
 * then, do DAW UI. well, state first. signals and tracks and clips.
 * figure out how automation should work especially. tonejs is neat.
 * make a bunch of sexy UI comps and whatnot to use.
 * a puck DND device creator UI thing would be sick.
